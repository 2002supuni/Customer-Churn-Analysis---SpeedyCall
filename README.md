ðŸš€ Analyzing Customer Churn: Data-Driven Strategies for Retention ðŸš€

Thrilled to share my latest project analyzing customer churn at Speedy Call! By leveraging statistical methods such as correlation analysis, chi-square tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and ANOVA, I explored how factors like Tenure, Contract Type, Monthly Charges, and Internet Service impact churn rates.

Key Insights:
ðŸ“‰ Longer tenures correlate with lower churn.
ðŸ“„ Month-to-Month contracts see the highest churn rates.
ðŸ’¸ Pricing strategies can significantly impact customer retention.
ðŸ“¡ Internet Service types require tailored retention approaches.

This project highlights the importance of data-driven decisions in tackling customer churn and improving retention strategies. Looking forward to implementing these insights in real-world scenarios!
